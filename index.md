## Semantic Neural Search (Research Project)
-   In this research project, we wanted to solve one of the most neglected, faced and important issue of searching media files like document, ebook, images, audio, videos.
-   Implemented **32 Repositories** having **28 microservices** containing state of the art **deep learning model** inference servers, in just mere 3 months. Features includes scalable large scale indexing of media files, 30-40 ms **deep ranking based search**, reverse-image search, reverse-face search, face-recognition search, reverse audio-search, typo-tolerant text search.
-   **Deep Learning models** included image-captioning, image-labeling, **object-detection- recognition, ocr, speech to text, sound recognition, face recognition**, BERT based text embedding extraction.
-   Tools and tech used- Azure Blob Storage, **MongoDb Grid  FS, Apache Kafka**, Fast API, Celery, Redis-Queue, **NodeJS**, ReactJS, **Redis, Docker**, Tensorflow, Pytorch, Elastic Search, Kibana, Log-Stash **Azure GPU VM**, BERT.
-   The Complete Project including all 32 repositories and their docker images are Open sourced here: https://github.com/semantic-search
## Touch to go
-   As a part of **Gujarat Industrial Hackathon  Finals**, our team developed a fully functioning Device that can **perform  Biometrics based Employee Attendance**. Our Project consist of a Production Ready hardware device that can run in local network having its own management based admin interface created in React JS

## Attendico
-   This was the winning project of the Hexa Hive Hackathon. In this project, we developed a **IOT device** using **raspberry pi** , web cam, **ultra sonic sensor** and a buzzer.
-   Our goal was to provide a smart solution to manage **attendance using Facial Recognition** and also provide a solution for security solutions to colleges.
-   We have a **React JS dashboard** for Registration of student and another admin dashboard for viewing all the attendances of students.

## Netra - Eyes for Blind
-   This project is an IOT project that helps provide **eyes to blind**. By press of a button a blind person can capture a single image and can hear what's around him using **image-recognition, object-detection, OCR and text-to-speech** deep learning models.
-   Tools and Tech - Raspberry-pi, Camera, Azure GPU VM,
**Fast-API (REST API)**.

## Reward Cycle
-   Created a community project using **Raspberry pi** and **face recognition** to give Rewards to anyone putting garbage in dustbin.
-   Implemented a **Social Media Webapp** with feed and profile features.
## Ingesting -the-Canadian-Common-CV
-   Created a **client project** in Python, Django and ElasticSearch and **contenerized** the whole project  in Docker. In this project I had to automate a ingest large **JSON** file to **MYSQL Db** and make the  data about diseases fully searchable using **REST APIS** of the same.

## Gestured Controlled Spotify
-   Created a Personal Project to **control Spotify** using **hand gestures** across cross devices.
-   Used **Spotify API, Open CV** and Gesture DL Models.
-   Gestures includes **"stop"** for Play/Pause song, **"thumbs up"** for Like Song, **"swipe"** for Next/Reverse Song and add to playlist.
